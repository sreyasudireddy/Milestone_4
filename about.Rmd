## About my Project
My project is on the effect of COVID-19 state social distancing policies on various outcomes such as positive test rate, deaths, and new administered tests. I chose this project because the pandemic is extremely relevant in the world right now and there is currently disparities in how different states have been handling social distancing policies. I got my data on state social distancing policies from the Kaiser Family Foundation (https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/). This data is updated regularly to reflect updated policies. I got data on COVID-19 stats from The COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/) and The New York Times. This data set provides various metrics on COVID-19 for every state and is also updated daily as new information comes in. For my final project, I plan on using the most updated data sets to reflect the current situation.

## Progress
This week, I created a separate Rmd file for the COVID stats data. I downloaded an additional data set from The New York Times to avoid the negative number issue for deaths and number of positive cases. I still have that issue for the number of tests in each state since I could not find that data elsewhere. Over the next few weeks, I will try to examine the issue in the data. My guess is that the value is zero and it defaulted to a negative number. With Ishan's help I was able to make the radio buttons work and now the graph changes with each state and variable (yay!). I also changed the colors to some of my favorite colors. I also changed the theme to make things look more aesthetic. I would also still like to figure out a way to show the different data points on the graphs when you toggle over it. Additionally, rather than a table for social distancing policies, I would like to create maps to make things more visually aesthetic and easier to compare between states. Eventually, I will also need to figure out a model.
