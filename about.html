<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Sreya Sudireddy. I am a senior at Harvard College studying Economics with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy. The URL to my Github Repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/sreyasudireddy/Milestone_4" class="uri">https://github.com/sreyasudireddy/Milestone_4</a></p>

<h2>About my Project</h2>
<p>My project is on the effect of COVID-19 state social distancing policies on various outcomes such as positive test rate, deaths, and new administered tests. I chose this project because the pandemic is extremely relevant in the world right now and there is currently disparities in how different states have been handling social distancing policies. I got my data on state social distancing policies from the Kaiser Family Foundation (<a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/" class="uri">https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/</a>). This data is updated regularly to reflect updated policies. I got data on COVID-19 stats from The COVID Tracking Project (<a href="https://covidtracking.com/" class="uri">https://covidtracking.com/</a>) and The New York Times. This data set provides various metrics on COVID-19 for every state and is also updated daily as new information comes in. For my final project, I plan on using the most updated data sets to reflect the current situation.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>This week, I created maps for each four social distancing measures (status of reopening, restaurant limits, large gathering limits, and mask requirements.) and I created a dropdown for each policy where the map changes for the policy selected. I would like to play around with the colors and formatting of the maps to make the tab look more aesthetic.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I will try to examine the issue in the data. My guess is that the value is zero and it defaulted to a negative number. If possible, I would also still like to figure out a way to show the different data points on the graphs when you toggle over it. Eventually, I will also need to figure out a model.</p>
