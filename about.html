<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Sreya Sudireddy. I am a senior at Harvard College studying Economics with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy. The URL to my Github Repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/sreyasudireddy/social-distancing-covid-stats" class="uri">https://github.com/sreyasudireddy/social-distancing-covid-stats</a></p>

<h2>About my Project</h2>
<p>My project is on the effect of COVID-19 state social distancing policies on various outcomes such as positive test rate, deaths, and new administered tests. I chose this project because the pandemic is extremely relevant in the world right now and there is currently disparities in how different states have been handling social distancing policies. I got my data on state social distancing policies from the Kaiser Family Foundation (<a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/" class="uri">https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/</a>). This data is updated regularly to reflect updated policies. I got data on COVID-19 stats from The COVID Tracking Project (<a href="https://covidtracking.com/" class="uri">https://covidtracking.com/</a>) and The New York Times. This data set provides various metrics on COVID-19 for every state and is also updated daily as new information comes in. For my final project, I plan on using the most updated data sets to reflect the current situation.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>This week, I created maps for each four social distancing measures (status of reopening, restaurant limits, large gathering limits, and mask requirements.) and I created a dropdown for each policy where the map changes for the policy selected.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I will try to examine the issue in the COVID stats data, where some numbers in the new tests data appear negative. My guess is that the value is zero and it defaulted to a negative number. Additionally, I will add more text to explain trends and interesting observations. If possible, I would also still like to figure out a way to show the different data points on the graphs when you toggle over it. Next week, I hope to figure out a model now that my intended visualizations are made. Lastly, the data is from Oct 12 and next week I will update the data sets to include more recent data as the data is updated everyday.</p>
