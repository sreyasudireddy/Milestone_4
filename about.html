<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Sreya Sudireddy. I am a senior at Harvard College studying Economics with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy. The URL to my Github Repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/sreyasudireddy/social-distancing-covid-stats" class="uri">https://github.com/sreyasudireddy/social-distancing-covid-stats</a></p>

<h2>About my Project</h2>
<p>My project is on the effect of COVID-19 state social distancing policies on various outcomes such as positive test rate, deaths, and new administered tests. I chose this project because the pandemic is extremely relevant in the world right now and there is currently disparities in how different states have been handling social distancing policies. I got my data on state social distancing policies from the Kaiser Family Foundation (<a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/" class="uri">https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/</a>). This data is updated regularly to reflect updated policies. I got data on COVID-19 stats from The COVID Tracking Project (<a href="https://covidtracking.com/" class="uri">https://covidtracking.com/</a>) and The New York Times. This data set provides various metrics on COVID-19 for every state and is also updated daily as new information comes in. For my final project, I plan on using the most updated data sets to reflect the current situation.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>This week, I added a graph for the number of new positive cases in each state. I thought that this would be an interesting metric to look at as I think about my model and how social distancing measures affect the number of new cases each day. To fix the negative number data, I looked at the documentation and determined that the true value was either not reported or 0 and therefore, I re-coded the negative numbers to zero to make the graphs make more sense despite not knowing the full story. There are relatively few data points like this, so I thought it was okay to recode all the negative numbers to zero. I also figured out how to use the plotly package to get the graphs to display the numbers when you toggle over the line, which is really great if someone wants to know the exact number on each day. Additionally, I updated both the COVID stats data and the social distancing data and both datasets should be updated until 11/11. I will most likely do 1-2 more updates before Demo Day and perhaps 1 more before the final project is due.</p>
<p>My next steps include adding more text to explain trends and interesting observations. Next week, I hope to figure out a model now that my intended visualizations are made.</p>
